# FAQ

## Which version of BEAUti do you use as a guideline?

Version 2.4.

## What's the roadmap?

For version (`v1.10`), the interface for one alignment will probably remain stable.

 * `v1.11`/`v2.0`: support two alignments well, allow shared site model, clock model and tree prior. This may change the interface of `create_beast2_input`. If that interface changes, new version will be `v2.0` 
 * `v1.12`/`v2.1`: support more than two alignments well
