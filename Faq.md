# FAQ

## Which version of BEAUti do you use as a guideline?

Version 2.4.7.

## What's the roadmap?

From version `1.10` onwards, the interface for one alignment will probably remain stable. 

 * `v2.0`: support multiple alignments well, allow shared site model, clock model and tree prior

There are some minor things that can be added, see 'How can I indicate a feature that I miss?'
to request so.

## How can I indicate something else?

Submit an Issue. Or send an email to Richel Bilderbeek.

## How do I reference to this work?

Article is still in preperation.

## What is the idea behind the logo?

The rat is a BEAST2 logo, symbolizing `BEAUti`. The R is the R mirrored of the R logo (the R logo also has a grey disc). 

The order of the symbols should be a rat and an R, as this is closes to reading `BEAUti-R`.
Because `beautier` is `BEAUti for R`, I mirrored the R, so that the rat would stand in front of ('before') the R. 

## What are the FASTA files?

FASTA files `anthus_aco.fas` and `anthus_nd2.fas` from:
 
 * Van Els, Paul, and Heraldo V. Norambuena. "A revision of species limits in Neotropical pipits Anthus based on multilocus genetic and vocal data." Ibis.

Thanks to Paul van Els.

FASTA files `test_output_0.fas`, `anthus_nd3.fas` and `anthus_nd4.fas`
are artificially made FASTA files.
