## road map

From version `1.10` onwards, the interface for one alignment will most likely remain stable. 

 * `v1.12`: support two alignments
 * `v1.13`: allow shared site model, clock model and tree prior (for two alignments) 
 * `v1.14`: support three alignments
 * `v1.15`: allow shared site model, clock model and tree prior (for three alignments) 

There are some minor things that can be added, see 'How can I indicate a feature that I miss?'
to request so.
