 * :white_check_mark: `v1.12.1`: simpler interface for specifying a fixed crown age
 * :white_check_mark: `v1.12.2`: remove cyclic dependencies on other related packages
 * ~~`v1.12.3`: remove `create_` in all functions to create a site model, clock model, tree prior, distribution, or parameter~~
 * `v1.13`: allow shared site model, clock model and tree prior (for two alignments) 
 * `v1.14`: support three alignments
 * `v1.15`: allow shared site model, clock model and tree prior (for three alignments) 

There are some minor things that can be added, see 'How can I indicate a feature that I miss?'
to request so.
